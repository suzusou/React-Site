I designed the `header and footer` in React.

## If you want to clone source code from github 
First, go to `any directory`.  
Next, clone the source code. (Execute the following command)  
```
git clone https://github.com/suzusou/React-Site.git
```  
Go to React-Site directory.
```
cd .\React-Site
```  
Eliminate dependent packages.

Now you can clone locally from github.
